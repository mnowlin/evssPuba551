# Policy Learning 

## Policy-Oriented Learning  

_Enduring alterations of thought or behavioral intentions that result from experience and which are concerned with the attainment or revision of the precepts of the belief systems of individuals or of collectives_ [@sabatierPolicyChangeLearning1993, 42]

# Two major insights in the Jones 2017 article

## Behavioral Rationality  

::: {.incremental}
* Comprehensive rationality 

* Bounded rationality 

* Behavioral organization theory 

* Problem space and solution space 

* Disproportionate information processing
:::

## Behavioral Rationality 

1. _Actors are behaviorally rational_ 

2. _Different dynamics can influence the problem space–understanding of the problem faced–and the solution space–the search and specification of alternatives to address that problem_ 

3. _The role of selective attention is critical in both problem definition and solution search_

4. _Emotional arousal is a dual-edged sword—it is critical in shifting the focus of attention, but it is also an essential component of cognition and hence reason_ 

-@jonesBehavioralRationalityFoundation2017, 73

## Policy Response

* Factors that lead to a disproportionate policy response 

* Elements of policy design 

* Climate policy

# What connections can we make between technocracy and democracy; evidenced-based policymaking; and information processing? 

::: {.notes}
delegation of information processing disrupts the demo - end; tech-means idea
