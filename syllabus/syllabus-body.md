# Course Description

**This course is required for students in the concurrent MES/MPA program and it is intended to be taken near the end of the program of study**. If you are not a concurrent student and are taking this course because it sounds interesting, _you should be a concurrent student_! Additionally, this course builds on core courses in both the MES and MPA programs, so if you are a concurrent student you should have taken most of the core courses in both programs before you take this course. _While this course counts for elective credit, it should be thought of as the only core course for concurrent MES/MPA students_.

\noindent From the CofC catalog: 

> This course examines the conduct and use of applied research in environmental organizations. Topics include the role of scientific information in policy definition and administration, the use and misuse of research data, the prospects for meaningful program evaluation and policy learning, and the influence of alternative organizational structures on the use of information.

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent The central question of this course is, _how is information and expert knowledge used for decision-making within and across organizations that address environmental issues_? To explore this question we will start by examining several foundational topics that will remain consistent themes throughout the course. These include technocracy and democracy; evidence-based policymaking; and information processing. Next, we will discuss governance and organizations including a brief overview of governance; organizations and public management; government agencies; and non-profits. Then, we will explore types of knowledge and how they are applied and communicated in the context of environmental decision-making. Knowledge types include science, policy analysis, benefit-cost analysis, and risk analysis. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion of the co-production of knowledge and deliberation.

\noindent The course will be conducted as a seminar and will be discussion based with very little lecture. Being able to adequately participate requires you to come to class prepared by having done the assigned readings prior to class. In addition, you should be prepared to participate in class by asking questions and making informed comments that add to the class discussion. 

## Prerequisites

**There are no officially required prerequisites for this course**; however, we will be building on concepts from several core MES/MPA courses, and your life will be easier if have had the following courses or their equivalent: 

* PUBA 600: Foundations of Public Sector Management and Leadership

* EVSS 601: Economic Theory for Policy Analysis

* PUBA 601: Research and Quantitative Methods for Public Administration

* EVSS/PUBA 602: Public Policy

* EVSS 611: Graduate Core Seminar

* EVSS 632: Social Science Methods in Environmental Studies

# Course Goals and Learning Objectives

The goals for this course are to:

* Lead and manage environmentally-focused agencies, organizations, and programs.

* Develop an understanding of how policy analysis is conducted and used in environmental policy decision-making.

* Participate in and contribute to the process by which sound environmental policies and programs are created, implemented, and evaluated.

* Understand, explain, and apply environmental science concepts and principles, in concert with administrative concepts and principles to solve public problems.

\noindent The Masters of Public Administration accrediting body, the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Administration, and Affairs (NASPAA) requires that we assess our student's mastery of the following required competencies:

-   Lead and manage in public governance

-   Participate in and contribute to the public policy process

-   Analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems, and make
	decisions

-   Articulate and apply a public service perspective

-   Communicate and interact productively with a diverse and changing
	workforce and citizenry

\noindent Each of these competencies will be addressed throughout this course; however, the most emphasis will be placed on developing students' abilities to **lead and manage in public governance**; **participate in and contribute to the public policy process**; and **analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems, and make decisions**.

# Course Information

## Readings

All of the required readings for the course will be available on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu) 

## Attendance Policy 

Attendance will be taken at each class session and will count toward your engagement grade. You are allowed to miss one class without penalty. 

## Technology Policy

**Laptops are not allowed**. If you feel you need a laptop to do well in this class please send me an email. All other devices should be put away.  _You should take notes by hand, with pen and paper_. [You learn better that way](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/learning/should-teachers-and-professors-ban-student-use-of-laptops-in-class.html). I recommend taking notes using the [Cornell Method](https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/). 

## Late Work Policy

_Note this is only applicable to the two short papers_. Late work is accepted; however, it will be penalized 10% each day (24 hr period) it is late, up to 3 days. After 3 days the assignment will not be accepted. For example, if an assignment is due Wednesday at 2:00 PM, it is late as of 2:01 PM and you lose 10%. After Thursday at 2:01 PM you lose another 10%, after Friday at 2:01 PM another 10%, and no work will be accepted after Saturday at 2:00 PM. _No late work will be accepted 72 hrs after the assignment due date and time_.

## Assignments

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent _Reflection Papers_: There will be 12 short (1 to 2-page) reflection papers assigned, _but only 10 will be graded_. For the reflection papers, a Word document with prompts will be placed on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu). You will download the Word doc, answer the prompts, and turn in your paper in the assignment folder on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu). **The response papers will be due by class time, 5:30 PM, each Wednesday, and late reflection papers will not be accepted**.
